// Returns the time required to travel along the path specified, in seconds.

// The travel time is the sum of the length/speed-limit of each street 
// segment, plus the given turn_penalty (in seconds) per turn implied by the path. 
// A turn occurs when two consecutive street segments have different street IDs.
